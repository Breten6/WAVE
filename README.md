# WAVE
a hand gesture controll smart home kit that can run on Raspberry Pi
•	Self-learned OpenCV and Dlib to develop a user authentication system, practiced Dlib and TensorFlow Lite models for precise face detection and similarity evaluation, ensuring accurate user recognition.
•	Integrated Google MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition, enabling seamless interaction with the smart home kits through intuitive hand movements.
•	Implemented a PID control system with dual servos for dynamic three-dimensional camera tracking of user's faces, significantly improving system responsiveness on a Raspberry Pi.
